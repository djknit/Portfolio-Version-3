# David Knittel's Portfolio

The purpose of this site is to showcase projects that I have worked on as a developer. The original basic design of the page was made to match images of an example page as required by my first homework for the KU Coding Bootcamp. Working from this design, I made some stylistic changes. I then used media queries to make the page responsive to changes in screen size, thus allowing the page to be viewed on mobile devices. I also designed all of the hover effects for linking elements on the page. I used jQuery to move the label on the portfolio icons on mouse hover and to create the links to the repository and the deployed page for each project. I used a Firebase real-time database to capture the input from the contact form.
