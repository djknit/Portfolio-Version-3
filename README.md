# Responsive-Portfolio

This page was originally developed by me as part of the first Bootcamp Homework. I used fonts and colors specified in the homework requirements and attempted to replicate the given example screenshots. I then used media queries to make the page adjust to fit properly on various screen sizes as part of the second Bootcamp homework.

This github repository was originally home to a different profile design made as part of an in-class activity. I replaced this original page with the responsive design mentioned above.
